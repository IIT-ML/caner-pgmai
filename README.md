Active inference for PGMs.

Currently focused on sensor data.

About the module readdata, this module requires either the original data file
or pickle files. Neither can be uploaded to Github due to the size restriction.
Please contact Caner for those files. Once gotten, a directory called data
should be created in the root path and data files should be placed in it.
